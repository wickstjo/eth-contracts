# Smart contract task queue
This repository holds an implementation for a proof-of-concept security protocol for handling IoT devices. The protocol uses smart contracts that implement a push then pull method for controlling IoT devices through the Ethereum blockchain. This enables us to harden IoT devices by disallowing any incoming connections, hence reducing attack vectors significantly. Distributed IoT security has been very problematic for a long time and we badly need a new protocol that is secure by design, allows service discovery, and provides a utilization of IoT devices. An analogy for the push then pull method is version control systems such as GIT.

We are currently working on extending the design and are looking at data-driven use cases. A research paper that describes the protocol is available as a [preprint version from arXiv](https://to-be-added)
